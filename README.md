Meal Tracking and Signature Capture App (React UI)
This repository contains the React-based frontend UI for the Meal Tracking and Signature Capture application. The app allows users to capture signatures and store them as S3 objects in AWS, with offline data handling and automated synchronization with DynamoDB.

For backend connectivity and data visualization, consider connecting with Appsmith or Streamlit to view metrics on meal consumption trends.
